1.  [DP] Consider a row of n coins of values v1 . . . vn, where n is even. We play a game against an opponent by 
    alternating turns. In each turn, a player selects either the first or last coin from the row, removes it 
    from the row permanently, and receives the value of the coin. 
    Determine the maximum possible amount of money we can definitely win if we move first.
    Note: The opponent is as clever as the user.
    
        For example: 
            coins[] = {5, 3, 7, 10}: The user collects maximum value as 15(10 + 5)
            coins[] = {8, 15, 3, 7}: The user collects maximum value as 22(7 + 15)
        
2.  [Tree] Given a Binary Tree, extract all leaves of it in a Doubly Linked List (DLL). Note that the DLL need 
    to be created in-place. Assume that the node structure of DLL and Binary Tree is same, only the meaning of 
    left and right pointers are different. In DLL, left means previous pointer and right means next pointer.
