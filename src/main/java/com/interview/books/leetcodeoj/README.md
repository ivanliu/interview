    - only scan the point is reachable from the first element
    - if j, k position both can reach i, step[j] < step[k], so scan from left to right, when found 1st valid break
    - use a maxJump to control the beginning of scan, int begin = i - maxStep < 0? 0 : i - maxStep; since element before begin can't directly jump to i.

        - offset still smaller than n, call read4 and copy data when (bufIdx < bufSize && offset < n)
        - if(bufSize < 4) break the while loop since there is no more data.
159. **Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters**  *Two Pointer, begin and next*
     - use two pointer begin and next, begin is the begin of the substring, (next + 1) is the option of next begin
     - so char between (next + 1) and i-th should be the same, so the two distinct char is s[i-1] and s[next]
     - loop on every char
        - if s[i] == s[i-1] just continue
        - else if(next == -1) next = i-1;
        - else if(s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(next)) next = i-1;
        - else if(s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(next)) more than two char, max = Math.max(max, i-begin), begin = next+1, next = i-1;
     - so the condition is:
        - if(s[i] == s[i-1]) continue;
        - if(next != -1 && s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(next)) max = Math.max(max, i-begin), begin = next+1;
        - next = i - 1;
     - at the end, need check max = Math.max(max, s.length() - begin);
160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists *Length*
     - use Length, if lenA > lenB, only move A, when lenA == lenB, move A and B together
161. One Edit Distance
     - make sure s is the longer one
     - edge case: if s.length() - t.length() > 1, return false
     - go through t, offset = 0 and shift = m - n; 
        - while(offset < n && s.charAt(offset) == t.charAt(offset)) offset++;
        - if offset == n, go util the end, check if m - n == 1;
        - if m == n, so both t and s need go one step forward, if m - n == 1, only s go one step forward
            - so if(shift == 0) offset++;
            - while(offset < n && s.charAt(offset + shift) == t.charAt(offset)) offset++;
     - return offset == n; scan till the end
162. Find Peak Element *Index Out of Range*
     - the condition of peak element is: num[i] > num[i-1] && num[i] > num[i+1]
     - be careful about the index out of range
163. Missing Ranges *Begin tracking*
     - create a util method: getRange(start, end) to handle "2" and "4->49" different range representation.
     - use a begin, init as start, to scan the vals, 
        - if begin < vals[i], create a range(begin, vals[i] - 1);
        - whatever, set begin = vals[i] + 1;
     - remember to set the last range after scan: if(begin <= end) create a range(begin, end);
164. **Maximum Gap** *Bucket Sort*
     - Bucket placement: range = max - min, bucketSize = (max - min)/n-1, bucketIdx = (num[i] - min)/bucketSize;
     - max gap = bucket[i].max - bucket[j].min, i and j are continuous non-empty bucket

        Suppose there are N elements and they range from MIN and MAX.
        Then the maximum gap will be no smaller than diff = ceiling[(MAX - MIN) / (N - 1)]
        Then we could create buckets to contains the element in range diff.
        Let the length of a bucket to be diff, then we will have at most ((MAX - MIN)/diff) + 1 of bucket
        
        For any element num[i] in the array, we can easily find out which bucket it belongs by calculating 
        bucketIdx = (num[i] - MIN)/diff and therefore maintain the maximum and minimum elements in each bucket.
        
        Since the maximum difference between elements in the same buckets will be at most len - 1, so the final 
        answer will not be taken from two elements in the same buckets.
        
        For each non-empty buckets p, find the next non-empty buckets q, then q.min - p.max could be the 
        potential answer to the question. Return the maximum of all those values.
        
165. Compare Version Number *Compare two list of number"
     - split version into numbers sequence, compare till end if equals, 
     - split(String regex), so "\\." instead of ".";
     - one sequence remain, return 0 if the remain sequence is all '0';
166. Fraction to Recurring Decimal *HashMap*
	 - use HashMap to store index of division of numerator in StringBuffer, if find existed numerator, make recurring
     - numerator and denominator can be negative, need tracking flag and change using Math.abs()
     - numerator and denominator can be out of range when do abs(), so need use Long
167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted *Two pointer: low and high*
     - low = 0, high = num.length - 1, get sum = num[low] + num[high]
        - if sum == target, return (low+1, high+1)
        - if sum < target, low++
        - if sum > target, high--
168. Excel Sheet Column Title *BASE26, BASE exchange*
     - convert to base26, special case for 1-26
     - since 'A' -> 1, 'B' -> 2, so do n-- to leftshift one every time.
        
        public String convertToTitle(int n) {
            StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer();
            while(n > 0){
                n--;
                char ch = (char)('A' + (n % 26));
                buffer.insert(0, ch);
                n = n / 26;
            }
            return buffer.toString();
        }
        
169. Majority Element *Counteract*
     - keep a element and count
        - if num[i] == element, count++
        - if num[i] != element and count > 0; count--;
        - if num[i] != element and count == 0; element = num[i], count = 1
170. Two Sum III - Data structure design
     - discuss about the time complexity needed for add() and find()
        - Hash table solution: add O(1), find O(N), space O(N)
        - Hash table solution to store pair sum: add O(N), find O(1), space O(N^2)
        - Sorted array or list solution: add O(N), find O(N), space O(N)
        - Array solution: add O(1), find(NlgN), space O(N). sort array when call find()
     - be careful about two same number sum to target, need tracking count of number using HashMap
171. Excel Sheet Column Number *BASE26, BASE exchange*
     - change base26 string to base10 number, rightshift one since 'A' -> 1, and 'B' -> 2.
172. Factorial Trailing Zeroes *Power of 5*
     - trailing zero can be generated by 2 and 5, so calculate how many number contains 5, 25, 125, power of 5, etc
     - how many number contains 5, is n/5, so count+= n/5, n/25, n/125, until n/power of 5 < 0
         
         public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
             int count = 0;
             if(n < 0) return -1;
             for(int i = 5; n / i > 0; i *= 5){
                 count += n / i;
             }
             return count;
         }
         
173. BSTIterator *Stack*
     - like use Stack do in-order traverse, have a pushLeft(node), push node in stack, and assign node to node.left
     - when init, pushLeft(root), when next(), pop() one from stack and pushLeft(node.right);
174. **DungeonGame**  *DP from right-down corner to left-up corner.* 
     - reversed DP calculation process: from right-down corner to left-up corner.
     - life[i][j] = Math.max(1, Math.min(life[i + 1][j], life[i][j+1]) - dungeon[i][j])
        - life[i][j] = Math.min(life[i + 1][j], life[i][j+1]) - dungeon[i][j])
        - if life[i][j] > 1, reset life[i][j] = 1, this will reduce the case positive after negative case.
179. Largest Number
     - change num into String and create a comparator of String s1 and s2, return 1 when s1+s2 > s2+s1 (parse to long value)
     - sort the strs using comparator and create largest number by scan backwards.
     - be careful of "all zero" cases.
186. Reverse Words in a String II
     - reverse the entire string, then reverse by word.
     - handle edge cases: if(s == null || s.length <= 1) return;
     - handle the last word
     - when found a ' ', next word start from i+1
187. Repeated DNA Sequence
     - use Integer to present char sequence, 00 for A, 01 for C, 10 for G, 11 for T, need 20 bit. (Integer)
     - scan string, generate new key by ((prev << 2) & 0x000FFFFF) + map.get(current);
     - count using HashMap
